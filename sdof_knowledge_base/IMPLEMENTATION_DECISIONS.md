# SDOF Knowledge Base Implementation Decisions

This document outlines the key implementation decisions made during the development of the SDOF Knowledge Base MCP server, including rationale, alternatives considered, and optimization strategies.

## 1. Architecture Decisions

### 1.1 Vector Database with MongoDB

**Decision:** Use MongoDB with vector search capabilities for storing knowledge entries and their vector representations.

**Rationale:**
- MongoDB's vector search functionality provides efficient similarity search without requiring a separate vector database
- Integration with existing document storage allows for hybrid search capabilities
- Mature ecosystem with robust drivers, documentation, and community support
- Flexible schema supports evolving knowledge representation needs

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Dedicated vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus)
  - Pro: Specialized for vector operations
  - Con: Would require maintaining two separate databases
- Elasticsearch with vector search plugin
  - Pro: Strong text search capabilities
  - Con: More complex setup and maintenance

### 1.2 Embedding Generation with OpenAI

**Decision:** Use OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model for generating vector embeddings.

**Rationale:**
- High-quality embeddings that capture semantic meaning effectively
- Consistent 1536-dimensional vectors with well-understood performance characteristics
- Simple API integration with good documentation
- Cost-effective for the expected usage patterns

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Local embedding models (Sentence Transformers, etc.)
  - Pro: No API costs, no external dependencies
  - Con: Higher computational requirements, potentially lower quality embeddings
- Other API providers (Cohere, Anthropic)
  - Pro: Alternative pricing models
  - Con: Less widespread adoption in vector search contexts

### 1.3 MCP Server Architecture

**Decision:** Implement the MCP server using Node.js with TypeScript and the Model Context Protocol SDK.

**Rationale:**
- TypeScript provides type safety and better code organization
- Async/await patterns work well for the embedding and database operations
- MCP SDK provides a structured way to expose tools and handle requests
- Easy integration with other JavaScript/TypeScript libraries

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Python implementation
  - Pro: Stronger ecosystem for ML/AI
  - Con: Less seamless integration with MCP SDK

## 2. Data Model Decisions

### 2.1 Knowledge Entry Schema

**Decision:** Design a flexible schema with content, metadata, and vector representation.

**Rationale:**
- Separate content and metadata enables efficient retrieval and filtering
- Category and tag fields support multiple organization strategies
- Access tracking fields (accessCount, lastAccessedAt) enable usage analytics
- Vector field stored alongside content simplifies retrieval

**Key Schema Elements:**
- `title`: Concise summary of the knowledge
- `content`: Main knowledge content
- `contentType`: Classification of content (text, code, decision, etc.)
- `category`: Primary organization category
- `tags`: Additional classification tags
- `vector`: Numerical vector representation (1536 dimensions)
- `sourceReference`: Optional reference to original source
- `accessCount`: Number of times the entry has been accessed
- `createdAt/updatedAt`: Timestamps for tracking entry lifecycle

### 2.2 Vector Representation

**Decision:** Store raw vector values in the database rather than quantized or compressed versions.

**Rationale:**
- Maintains maximum fidelity for search operations
- MongoDB efficiently handles the vector storage and indexing
- Simplifies implementation without additional compression/decompression steps

**Future Improvements:**
- Vector quantization for larger datasets
- Dimension reduction techniques for specific knowledge domains

## 3. Performance Optimization Decisions

### 3.1 Two-Level Caching Strategy

**Decision:** Implement separate caches for embeddings and search results.

**Rationale:**
- Embedding cache reduces API calls to OpenAI, saving cost and latency
- Search cache improves response time for repeated similar queries
- Separate TTLs allow different expiration policies based on usage patterns
- In-memory caching with NodeCache provides good performance without external dependencies

**Cache Design:**
- Embedding cache: Longer TTL (1 hour default) to maximize cost savings
- Search cache: Shorter TTL (5 minutes default) to balance freshness and performance

### 3.2 Hybrid Search Implementation

**Decision:** Combine vector search with text search for more robust retrieval.

**Rationale:**
- Vector search excels at semantic matching but may miss exact keyword matches
- Text search provides complementary strengths for exact matching
- Combined approach improves recall while maintaining precision
- Fallback to text search if vector search is unavailable

**Implementation Approach:**
- Run both search types in parallel
- Deduplicate and combine results
- Prioritize vector search results when both methods return the same entry

### 3.3 Error Handling and Retry Logic

**Decision:** Implement robust error handling with fallback mechanisms and retries.

**Rationale:**
- External API calls (OpenAI, MongoDB) may occasionally fail
- Retry with exponential backoff improves resilience without overwhelming services
- Fallback mechanisms (e.g., text search when vector search fails) maintain functionality

**Key Implementations:**
- `retryWithBackoff` utility for API calls
- Fallback to text search when vector search fails
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting

## 4. API Design Decisions

### 4.1 MCP Tool Design

**Decision:** Create a comprehensive set of tools for knowledge management and retrieval.

**Rationale:**
- Separate tools for different operations provides clear interfaces
- Detailed input schemas help users understand required parameters
- Comprehensive set of operations enables flexible interaction with the knowledge base

**Tool Categories:**
- Knowledge Management: store, update, delete
- Knowledge Retrieval: search, get by id, get by category/tag
- System Management: clear caches

### 4.2 Search Parameter Design

**Decision:** Allow flexible search parameters with reasonable defaults.

**Rationale:**
- Different use cases require different search strategies
- Defaults should work well for common scenarios
- Advanced users can customize search behavior

**Key Parameters:**
- `query`: The search text
- `searchType`: Vector, text, or hybrid (default)
- `limit`: Maximum number of results to return

## 5. Testing and Validation Decisions

### 5.1 Test Strategy

**Decision:** Implement comprehensive unit tests with mocks for external dependencies.

**Rationale:**
- Mocking external dependencies (MongoDB, OpenAI) enables fast, reliable tests
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures robustness
- Jest provides a good balance of features and simplicity

**Testing Approach:**
- Mock database operations to test service logic
- Mock embedding generation to test without API calls
- Test all search methods and edge cases

### 5.2 Performance Benchmarking

**Decision:** Create dedicated benchmark tooling to measure and compare performance.

**Rationale:**
- Quantitative measurements enable informed optimization
- Comparing different approaches (vector vs. text vs. hybrid) provides insights
- Benchmarks serve as regression tests for future changes

**Benchmark Categories:**
- Embedding generation performance
- Database operation speed
- Cache effectiveness
- Search method comparison

## 6. Future Enhancement Considerations

### 6.1 Distributed Processing
