# Description

This task defines the main workflow for the SDOF Analyzer mode, responsible for Phase 2: Detailed Analysis. It performs in-depth analysis of explored solutions.

# Acceptance Criteria

- Analyze solution options generated in Phase 1.
- Evaluate feasibility, risks, and benefits.
- Save analysis results automatically to the SDOF knowledge base.
- Integrate with SDOF Knowledge Base for context retrieval.
- Delegate to `sdof-implementer` upon completion.
- Use MDTM task management for tracking.

# Checklist

- [ ] Retrieve exploration plans from knowledge base.
- [ ] Perform detailed analysis of solutions.
- [ ] Document analysis findings.
- [ ] Save analysis using `store_sdof_plan` MCP tool.
- [ ] Delegate to `sdof-implementer` for Phase 3.
