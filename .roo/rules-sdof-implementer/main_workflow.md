# Description

This task defines the main workflow for the SDOF Implementer mode, responsible for Phase 3: Implementation. It implements the selected solution.

# Acceptance Criteria

- Implement the solution based on analysis results.
- Document implementation steps and progress.
- Save implementation details automatically to the SDOF knowledge base.
- Integrate with SDOF Knowledge Base for context retrieval.
- Delegate to `sdof-evaluator` upon completion.
- Use MDTM task management for tracking.

# Checklist

- [ ] Retrieve analysis results from knowledge base.
- [ ] Implement solution components.
- [ ] Document implementation progress.
- [ ] Save implementation using `store_sdof_plan` MCP tool.
- [ ] Delegate to `sdof-evaluator` for Phase 4.
