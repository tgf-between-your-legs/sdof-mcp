# Description

This task defines the main workflow for the SDOF Orchestrator mode. It coordinates the entire 5-phase SDOF process by delegating tasks to each phase mode in sequence and managing overall progress.

# Acceptance Criteria

- The orchestrator delegates Phase 1 to `sdof-explorer`.
- After Phase 1 completes, it delegates Phase 2 to `sdof-analyzer`.
- After Phase 2 completes, it delegates Phase 3 to `sdof-implementer`.
- After Phase 3 completes, it delegates Phase 4 to `sdof-evaluator`.
- After Phase 4 completes, it delegates Phase 5 to `sdof-integrator`.
- After Phase 5 completes, it logs completion and optionally restarts or ends the workflow.
- The orchestrator uses MDTM task management for tracking.
- The orchestrator integrates with SDOF Knowledge Base for context retrieval.
- The orchestrator triggers automatic saving to the SDOF knowledge base after each phase.
